# Threats

There are many types of threats but typically an attacker wishes to

- gain access to a system they are not part of (authentication)
- gain access to resources they are not allowed to access (authorization)

First, let us consider what threats there actually are. Attacks can generally be
categorized as the following;

## Brute force attacks

A brute force attack consist of trying a vast amount of different passwords in
order to gain access to a system.

## Denial of service

DoS (Denial of Service). A target is flooded with requests, causing it either
slow down answering legitimate requests or going down completely. These attacks
can be both fast and slow.

There also ADoS (Amplified Denial of Service) attacks where one uses a server to
amplify the attack.

## Other attacks

- [SQLI](sqli)
- [XSS](xss)
- [XSRF](crsf)
