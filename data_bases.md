# Databases

## Relational databases

A relational database imposes a relational structure on its data. This structure is described in schemas. Most relational databases support Structured Query Language (SQL).

### ACID

- **Atomicity**. A transaction involving several entities fail all or succeed all.
- **Consistency**. If there is an error in a transaction, the database will be rolled back.
- **Isolation**. Although queries are run in parallell they behave as if serial.
- **Durability**. Changes to the database are permanent.

## Indexes

One can index a columb for faster search speeds in exchange for slower writes and more memory consumption.

## Non-relational databases

A non-relational database (often referred to as NoSQL).
