# URL

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a web address.

Consider the URL `http://localhost:8080/alpha?bravo=charlie#delta`. It consists
of several parts;

- schema (`http`), also known as protocol
- host (`localhost`), also known as hostname
- port (`8080`)
- path (`/alpha`)
- query (`?bravo=charlie`)
- fragment (`#delta`)

There are some additional terms

- netloc (`localhost:8080`), the hostname and port. This is also sometimes
  called host
